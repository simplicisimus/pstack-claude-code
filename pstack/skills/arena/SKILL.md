# Arena

Fan out N parallel attempts at the same task. Read every candidate end to end. Pick the strongest as the base. Graft the best ideas from the others into it. Verify the synthesized result.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Cross-judge
4. Pick
5. Graft
6. Verify

## Phase A: Frame

The N candidates will receive the same prompt, so the prompt is the contract.

1. State the artifact each candidate is producing.
2. Derive the rubric. State what success looks like for *this* task, then turn it into 3-6 concrete gradeable criteria. The rubric is the picker's tool in Phase D. Candidates only see the task.
3. Pick the runners. Use the `arena runners` line in `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, default to one each on `opus`, `opus`, `sonnet`. Resolve the line with `pstack-role --seat write --panel --default 'opus, opus, sonnet' 'arena runners'` when the runners write code, or `--seat review --panel` when their artifact is a document. Resolve the cross-judge pool below as a review seat without `--panel`, since the pool yields one judge. `pstack-role` applies the value grammar in the **setup-pstack** skill and prints one line per seat with its `subagent_type`, its `model` when one applies, and the brief of a bridge seat. A runner whose artifact is code is a write seat: spawn it with `isolation: "worktree"`, and a `codex:` or `grok:` runner gets `Mode: write`, so its worktree is its output path. A runner whose artifact is a document is a review seat: a `codex:` or `grok:` runner gets `Mode: review`, and you copy its answer file to its output path. An `openrouter:` runner returns its artifact as text, and you write it to its output path. If a configured entry fails to spawn or a bridge replies `FAILED`, run that seat on `opus` and say so. A disabled alias drops its seat instead. Spawn more when the arena covers multiple design directions. Same model N times when the work is generation-bound rather than judgment-sensitive.
4. Assign output paths. Each candidate writes to its own location (a git worktree where possible, otherwise `/tmp/arena-<slug>/candidate-<n>/`), per the **separate-before-serializing-shared-state** principle skill.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N subagents in one message with `run_in_background: true`, each with the task, the path to the shared grounding, its own output path, and instructions to produce both the artifact and a short rationale.

Each rationale names the alternatives the candidate considered and what it rejected.

If a candidate fails to produce output, proceed with N-1 and note the dropout in the synthesis record.

## Phase C: Cross-judge

After all Phase B candidates complete, choose one model from the `arena cross-judge pool` line in `~/.claude/pstack-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, choose from `opus`, `sonnet`. Prefer an entry that differs from the parent's model. A `codex:`, `grok:`, or `openrouter:` entry (or an `agent:` backed by a non-Claude model) is the strongest choice when the pool has one. With a Claude-only pool, the judge's fresh context is the main source of independence. Spawn one judge on that model as a review seat: `pstack:reviewer` for a Claude model, `Mode: review` for a bridge. It sees the rubric and the candidates by path label, scores each criterion, and recommends a base with rationale. It runs in parallel with the parent's reading in Phase D, not with the candidates themselves. Don't spawn the judge while candidates are still writing.

## Phase D: Pick a base

Read every candidate end to end before picking.

Score each candidate against the rubric criterion by criterion, not on holistic feel. Compare against the cross-judge. Agreement on the base confirms the pick. Disagreement means one of you is biased or the rubric was ambiguous. Read both rationales before deciding.

Pick the base on which candidate a future maintainer can extend most easily without breaking invariants. Prefer the cleaner boundary or smaller API when two feel tied, per the Laziness Protocol.

Record the pick and the reason in a short synthesis note alongside the base artifact, including the cross-judge's verdict.

## Phase E: Graft

Walk each losing candidate once more and identify what is worth porting into the base. The signal is usually one or two things per candidate, not most of it.

Fold each graft in by hand, per the **redesign-from-first-principles** principle skill. Don't paste mechanically. The result has to remain coherent under one mental model.

Record what was grafted, from which candidate, and what was rejected and why.

When N candidates converge on the same shape, that is a strong agreement signal. Note the convergence in the record and ship the consensus shape. No graft is needed. When N candidates wildly diverge, Phase A was under-specified. Reframe and re-run rather than averaging the divergence.

## Phase F: Verify

The synthesized artifact has to hold up under the same scrutiny as any other output, per the **prove-it-works** principle skill.

If verification surfaces a problem the arena did not catch, either Phase A was wrong (re-frame and re-run) or one candidate caught it and you missed the graft (go back to Phase E). Don't paper over.

## Outputs

One synthesized artifact. One short synthesis note alongside, naming the base, the grafts (with source candidate), the rejections, the dropouts if any, and the verification result.

## pstack on Claude Code

When you run this skill directly, `<pstack>` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `<store>` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/store`, and this session's ID is `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`. When poteto-mode, another pstack skill, or a brief sent you here, use the values it names. Other pstack skills named here (in bold, or as `principle-*`) live at `<pstack>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. They are user-invocable only, so Read them with the Read tool instead of the Skill tool. Per-role models come from `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` (see the **setup-pstack** skill). Cursor-specific terms, and a todolist in a session without a todo tool, map per `<pstack>/skills/poteto-mode/references/claude-code.md`.
