## pstack on Claude Code

When you run this skill directly, `<pstack>` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `<store>` is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/store`, and this session's ID is `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`. When poteto-mode, another pstack skill, or a brief sent you here, use the values it names. Other pstack skills named here (in bold, or as `principle-*`) live at `<pstack>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. They are user-invocable only, so Read them with the Read tool instead of the Skill tool. Per-role models come from `~/.claude/pstack-models.md` (see the **setup-pstack** skill). Cursor-specific terms, and a todolist in a session without a todo tool, map per `<pstack>/skills/poteto-mode/references/claude-code.md`.
